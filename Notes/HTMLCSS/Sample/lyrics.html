        Stressed out
        Feelin' lost and I don't what to do now
        What I chose ain't really gonna work out
        Fallin' six feet underneath the floor now
        Think I'm gonna tap out

        Feel bad, go to bed
        Wake up even worse, yeah
        So sad in my head
        Feelin' like a curse
        I need medicine, medicine, medicine
        All my skeletons out for the taking
        I don't even know if I'ma make it
        I'm afraid of myself and I hate it
        All my skeletons out for the taking
        Somebody take 'em

        I wanna ride away
        The day to day is taking its toll on me
        And I'm tearing at the seams
        Throw it all away
        Give a fuck about what they say
        I gotta disagree
        This ain't really fun for me

        Feel bad, go to bed
        Wake up even worse, yeah
        So sad in my head
        Feelin' like a curse
        I need medicine, medicine, medicine
        All my skeletons out for the taking
        I don't even know if I'ma make it
        I'm afraid of myself and I hate it
        All my skeletons out for the taking
        Somebody take 'em
